# USELESS ALARM 🎯


## Basic Details

### Project Description
[A beautifully useless alarm clock that rewards you for hitting snooze. Wake up just to win absolutely nothing—except fake points and good vibes.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Waking up on time is overrated. Traditional alarm clocks are too efficient—they expect you to get out of bed and be productive. Where’s the fun in that?
👉 No one was rewarding people for hitting snooze.
👉 No one was congratulating sleepers for ignoring their responsibilities.
👉 No one was saying “Happy Sleeping” when you gave up on waking up

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Useless Alarm Clock – a groundbreaking invention that lets you set alarms just so you can snooze them and get imaginary rewards. Yep, we built a whole website to celebrate doing nothing.

🔔 Set an alarm (only between 5:30 AM and 8:00 AM because… why not?)
😴 Snooze it like a champion
🎁 Receive fake points, ridiculous rewards, and a warm “Happy Sleeping” message
🎶 All while vibing to a built-in jam you didn’t ask for

Basically, we turned procrastination into a feature. You're welcome.
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Languages used:
HTML5 (because we needed a skeleton)
CSS3 (to make it look slightly less useless)
JavaScript (for the magic behind the snooze rewards)

Frameworks used:
None. This project is too small and unserious for one 😎

Libraries used:
Also none. Pure vanilla JS, like the good ol’ sleep-deprived days

Tools used:
VS Code (with occasional dark mode naps)
Git & GitHub (for version control and hosting)
Google Chrome (a.k.a. the test lab)
A semi-working brain and a desperate need to procrastinate

### Implementation
For Software:
This project is a 100% front-end masterpiece (read: HTML, CSS, JS with no backend logic because sleep doesn't require databases). It runs entirely in the browser — no setup required, no servers harmed.
# Installation
Just visit the GitHub Pages link:
https://Mehjebin-Nasar.github.io/useless-alarm-clock/
No install, no thinking, just snoozing.

# Run
No compilers. No servers. No sleep required (but recommended). Just open the file and vibe.

🖥️ To run locally:
bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/useless-alarm-clock.git
